# Blueprint Truffle Box

This box comes with everything you need to get started on your own Truffle Box.

## Getting Started

First, fork this repository to create your own repository and make edits. Then, start adding your libraries and code!
See the [Create your own Truffle Box](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box.html) section of our documentation on how to do so.

## Truffle Site Listing

In order for your box to be published, we have a few requirements to make sure it's in tip-top shape to get released.

Please include detailed instructions to help the community get started using it right away! To do so:

1. Fill out our [template README](./readme-template.md). Note that not everything in the template may apply, or you may need to expand it to best fit your box. See our [Optimism Box](https://github.com/truffle-box/optimism-box) for a great example!

2. Rename the file to `README.md`.

Please also include the images you wish to be displayed with your box. To do so:

1. Delete `box-img-sm.png` and `box-img-lg.png`.

2. Use `box-img-sm-template.png` and `box-img-lg-template.png` to create your own art.

3. Delete the template images and replace them with your art. Be sure your art's filenames don't have -template in them.

4. Customize the box configuration file (`truffle-box.json`) if necessary.

For more detailed instructions on what we look for and how to submit, see the [Truffle Site Listing](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box/#truffle-site-listing) section of our documentation.
